Toastmaster Gratitude. Thank you for a sergeant off arms and my better have those Master Priscilla who is open this meeting and who has done a lot off the ground work for today's meeting, so please a big round of applause to her Now. The person who made this meeting possible obviously is a district director. DTM professor Coleman, who initiated, came up with this idea saying, Gee, we need to do something. And so who better to start this meeting, then our district director? Good evening, everybody. And welcome to our new era, which is the online meeting I took. I send an email to the I to take permission for our district to make online meeting, and I will forward the email for you to make sure that we are allowed to do online meeting in your club. But before doing that, we need to know that tips and techniques to do online meetings. It's my pleasure to be with you practice this online meeting and connecting with all leaders, most of the leaders in our district. However, when I when Alka came back from the from the from London, she said, Rafa, they are doing online leaping there. We need to do something. The first person come to my mind is scheduled, and I met him. Talk to him and we set up this hope this will be a good learning experience for all of us. And when the meeting is done, we will share the video recording toe all district members, whoever attended or not attended. Besides, we're going to do another session just in Arabic. So we have the hack cup that had a fallible club First media Mona will do the translation for the presentation and we will do everything the same. But in Arabic version for the people who speaks in Arabic, back to the moderator or the toastmaster off the evening Kasuga. Thank you, Catoctin. I returned the floor back to you. So you need to a newt yourself and I'm muting myself. Thank you. Thank you. Dtm Buffa District director And our next speaker was supposed to be Dtm Mohammed Salim, a pick you d But I have reached out to him and he told me he will join a little later on. So when he does come, I will ask him to address all off the attendees. Next we have our club growth Director Tim Alka camera and I will now hand over the mike, tow her, But because there are so many people here, I have to locate her It's quite a nice screen that I can see in front. Off Main T team. Okay. Okay. I found you. Please proceed. Good evening. Uh, district Director Wafa. Good evening. A decaf gotten on toe. All the attendees here. It's Ah, Riel. Pleasure to see this actually happening. A thing that I was hoping toe have ever since I spoke toe dd about it because I was really concerned by the meetings being canceled. It's a real challenge for us. It's really understandable that meetings are canceled, but we cannot stop the journey off Those masters on B. We being Toastmasters are much more hardier hardy than the virus, I'm sure. So this is what I wanted to happen on. We have had a couple of meetings that have already happened with challenges SSP and a couple in, uh, and also order yesterday on also a few in Bahrain. So this gives me a really pleasure that this training comes at an opportune time and more and more clubs will be doing that so that we continue to reap the benefits off those masters. Our membership does not in any way go waste. So we continue with our renewables because This is a crucial time when we are going through renewables. Uh, and I have come across members saying, Perhaps what's the use of renewing? But members we know this is a temporary phase on online meetings are a really exciting thing to do. Eso I really appreciate deliver ofa for taking this initiative for Eddie catch written to really bring this to actual? Um, we are really starting with it. So thanks to you for that and I hope more and more clubs will follow on. We'll continue to have our online meetings. Tooth, We are through the challenge. Back to you. Toes must off the day. Thank you. DT Malka for the that Andi. Now we will move into the actual tutorial, the zoo deuterium. But for me, there's soon. Tutorial is not really about the technical part off it, so I will cover that. But how do we run a meeting? First off, all, if you ask me, is a virtual meeting better than a really meeting off course not. But if you ask me, is it better to have a meeting or not have a meeting at all? Then ofcourse, the answer becomes Yes, we have to have a meeting and I strongly believe that if we really want to develop and we want to do this virtual meeting still, the crisis is over and the government else's it's okay. You can start having social gatherings. Till then, we can continue having our online meetings, but to get the best out off it, we should do the meeting in the best possible way. So rather than just focusing on the technical part of it, I would address a certain thing here today. Like, how can this meeting be productive? And at seven o'clock, we will start a demo meeting and we'll see how it is the first thing I would like to address. And these are my five points. And please see if you can incorruptible this five points as we start this meeting. First of all, the Sergeant of Arms has already mentioned quite wrong without any distraction, because think off, it is coming for a meeting. Even though you're sitting at home, think off it is actually attending a toastmaster meeting. And what do we do that we switch off our phones so the same rule applies? Please put it on silent mode. So it doesn't get distracted. There is no as far as possible as far as possible. Maybe close the room so that you know the cat doesn't come and jump on, say, on top of you on it would then at the end of the day, distract the speaker. So try to imagine this to be a actual meeting, and that way it would then give us the same benefits off a meeting. The second thing is not to try to do is try to be in a valid environment. Because at the end, off the day when we're speaking, we want to see you. And so some off you'll have switched off your video, for example. No, the speaker would want to see when he makes a joke. For example, are you laughing? But if I see all black dots, what do I know? Is it working or doesn't for is not working. So the interaction to make it as a really meeting you need Toby with video on with a valid environment, I would ideally assume that would expect at least you all. If you all are going to conduct this meeting for your members, use a laptop because First of all, the video will be very stable. It will not be distracting. But if you're holding a phone in front off you, you know and it's shaking all the time, then it does get distracted. But if you just keep it in a stable area, then I can see all of you are moving around your face. You're smiling. That's great. Okay, that's the type of experience we should create. Try to create the club experience. Audio is very important. So when I speak, it shouldn't come Teeny voice. It should come clear, especially if you're a speaker. For example. You need to be clear. The audience should be able to hear you, though value two should be able to hear you. And so a small investment, for example, in a headset with probably a microphone would be a good investment. Andi, they don't cost too much off u K D. I guess in my case, I'm using a conference system, so I'm only using the headphone for the voice, but my camera and my audio is being captured by a professional system. But a simple headset with the microphone would be good enough if you're using for example of mobile, maybe invest in our Bluetooth headset so that you can hear clearly. Oh, your voice also will be very audible to the audience and finally the angle of the camera. Try to keep the camera at the same angle as your face, and I see most off you have that some off you're keeping it down and then I look at your face and it looks with skerry, So try to keep the angle of the camera at the same level of your face, so it looks flattering. You have one minute to adjust yourself because I want to see all of you all. I want to see you in a good light because a speakers, when they deliver, will also want to see you as much as possible. And one of the reasons. And it really looks lovely here because I'm using a big 27 inch monitor. I can see all the speakers in one screen can imagine, and I take a school Richard off its I can share it on. I was hoping that everyone's video is on. It would look even better. Some of us still Isabelle your video, but that's fine. Yeah, So get this few tips on the A ticket off a toastmaster meeting. Because here we're not talking about zoom meeting. We're talking about the etiquette off toastmaster meeting White Room. Well, it good audio. Keep it stable. And now we are ready, toe. Actually, be part off those master meeting if you're using a phone, One suggestion I would have is you know, this very keep, uh, try parts that you get with a phone holder. If you put keep that in front off your face, You know, then it is as good as what I am doing it. The quality off the phone is good enough. So you put then, uh, right. Very clear, both audio as well as video. Now, the question which comes is why soon Lydia Wafa asked me Why don't we use for example, Goto have been a one off the quite a famous, uh, tool used for holding meetings and the reason why all those master, especially on the online toastmaster clubs the EU's soon is because it is meant with a meeting in mind, not meant with the training in mind. So if I was just going toe do turning today, I would have preferred go to Webinar, for example, because it allows me toe train thousands off people. I could have invited people from all over the world, but I wanted here to experience. Also, the meeting on 15 are is not a good tool to run meetings because, as I said, I want to see your face. I want to see who's paying attention to me, whose, uh, enjoying what I'm saying Because I can see all your faces. You all can see others faces. So the video aspect off it is very important. And this is what zoom does really well. So all of you, those of you who don't have a zoom account at the end of this meeting will goto www xoom com and sign up for an account. Okay, by the way, we shall have note bad toe. Make a note off all of this because I will be sharing a power point off with all of this information. But the thing is, you need to have a zoom account so that you can create your own meeting. So that's doubling, doubling zoom dot com on, create a free account and then download the software so that you can start running the meetings because if you want to run your own meeting, you need to do it from the computer you need toe. Set it up from a laptop or a computer because there are so many settings that have to be done, which are done best on a Web browser only on a big screen. And also when you're running the meeting, you need to see all the attendees, which you will be finding it very difficult if you were doing it on a mobile. So your members who are signing up joining the meeting, they can off course, use the mobile. But you who are running the meeting should do it from your laptop computer. Whatever is you have it all. So that's part off the process off why we're using soon and how we can you zoom to run a toastmaster meeting. So the question is is so free. The answer is yes and no. You can use a free account off soon, but with a free account, you are limited toe 40 minutes off meeting only, and that means it is not suitable for toastmaster meeting because we want to do a meeting that is longer than 40 minutes. Which makes the question, then how much does it cost? If I want to run the rial toastmaster meeting, the answer is five k 80 per month. So that's the subscription that you need to pay. And it depends now because we're not really doing this for a long period. He may be doing it for the next one meeting maximum two meetings. So is it worth the investment? Maybe you can subscribe only for one month and then cancel the subscription. This is one way. Or you could probably share the subscription like mine. For example, I could share my any club that wants to run the meeting, and it is not conflicting with anything that I'm doing, and I usually don't do much with soon, so feel free to use my account to run your meeting. Do it as a test Onda uh, see, because I don't recommend using the free version for a toastmaster meeting, you are free to do that. They create a free account and try, let's say X com meeting one good way. Advantage off it is. You're sure it will finish in 40 minutes. So you have to rush and complete your explore meeting. So it was one dragon. Or you can just try a videoconferencing between few members to discuss some issues off the club. It's very good to do that, but if you want really a toastmaster meeting, I recommend a pro account which cost five carry, which is around $15 per month. So now I have a pro account. I have assume account, and I will now show you how we can schedule a meeting. It's very simple. It's protect us only five minutes. So at the end off this session, or sign up for Zoom, create a free account and create the meeting. As I show, you know, and I will be not focusing on each and every technical aspect off. So this one can be used for so many things. I will only tell you what is required to run a toastmaster meeting because that's a focus today. Yeah, mhm. Before that, you're the screen looks so beautiful. Let me take one more screen shot. What? We can post this toe Beautiful, beautiful. We'll post this to district not district the official toastmaster group. Now I will switch to my toe the my screen and let's go to assume dot com zoom. Good thump. Yeah. Is your fingers if you can see my screen? Mhm. So I already have an account. Okay. And as you can see, this is the meeting which is currently in progress. I have also scheduled a meeting on Friday for bright horizons. So that will be also online. I guess Bright horizon steam will be sharing the links with you so you shall want to try and a really toastmaster meeting, which is happening very soon. You are more than welcome to join the meeting Took. So what do we need to do to schedule a new meeting? Nothing much. Just save scheduled, a new meeting and even the meeting name. So let's say we're planning something for quick challenges soon. Number 41. I don't know what's the number online meeting. So I give a topic and a description. I choose the date when I want to hold it. Let's say we're going to do it on 16 at six o'clock for two hours on. This is as I said. If you want to do it to our meeting, you need a pro account now very few things you need to keep in mind. First of all, registration. Is it required or not for toastmaster meetings? I don't recommend. And even for this particular meeting I have made it has no registration required. If I say registration required, then obviously you have to have a zoom account. You have tow register for that meeting and only those people and it becomes more complicated. The second part is how What meeting idea do you want to give? So when you have a pro account you have two options. So you have a fixed meeting idea which you can use any time. And the second option is you have a new meeting idea every time. And for those master meetings, you must have a new meeting idea every time. Why is that? Because for every meeting that you create, you can have different goals, different results. Who was the best speaker? So what will happen is they will be all kept separately under different meeting idea. So for those master meetings, let the system generate for you new meeting idea everything. Do you need a password? I don't recommend it becomes additional Hessel toe manage passwords sharing passwords for more complicated meetings. You may want to choose passwords, but for those masters I don't recommend. Then what about the video, then? Uh, when host. When member joints. Let's event for the host when he joins the meeting. Do you want the video honor off? This is very simple. You can leave it on off. It doesn't matter because it can be always changed at anything. So I have kept it off. But as you can see, you can switch it on if you want the other part. I would like to keep the notice the or to you. Normally, you can use your mobile phone audio or your laptop audio, which is a computer audio. But Zoom also gives an option to dialing, especially if you're us and all that you can dial in for the audio you can choose. I don't think they support to it. So that's why I forced always to be computer audio. So whatever would you have if a mobile phone have a laptop, you lose that what you're only and it works fine for me. A few more options that we can take here is that do you want join before the host. So if you are the toastmaster off the day and if you are late, should the members wait for you to join into the meeting room? So if he's click here, it means they can directly come into the meeting room. If you remove it off, it means you must wait for the toastmaster off the day or whoever is running this meeting toe come and admit you into the room in In this particular meeting, I have said, actually, it doesn't matter for me, but so you can choose. I would advice to keep enable on because any member if he's early also, you can come for the meeting. You will find the meeting room ready for you. New participants on entry. Definitely, because what will happen? A speaker is giving a speech on DSO. Suddenly a new remember joints and his audio is on what will happen. It will distract the speaker. So when you say mute participants on entry when they joined the meeting by default there, the uh microphone will be switched off. Nobody can we can see their face or if the video is on, but we won't be ableto hear them which is good. Do you want to enable the waiting room? A waiting room is also a good idea. Toe keep, especially the toastmaster meeting. I'll tell you why again. If the speaker is speaking and then member decides to join the meeting, suddenly his face will pop up on the screen and maybe the speaker will get distracted. So what? The toastmaster off the day or the person controlling the meeting will do is he'll enable the waiting room. So during that speech, the waiting room with all the people who are coming, they will be kept in the waiting room. So imagine if it is in a toastmaster meeting. The sergeant off arms is blocking the door, not letting the people come in till the speeches over. It's like that. The ones the speeches over the toastmaster off the bacon. Check if there are any members waiting in the waiting room and then bring them in. And this is what I'm doing, by the way, right now I have enabled waiting room so that if any member comes, I first look at it and then admit So what will happen when Bopha, our district director, is giving a speech. I will make sure that people are not brought into the meeting when the speech is going on, when an evaluation is going on, they will be in the waiting room and then they will be brought in thing. And the last thing is, do you want to record the meeting? It's up to you If you want to share the meeting with others on whether authenticated users only can join. If you say authenticated users, that means all of them must have zoom account. Now, many off you don't have zoom account. So if I had enable this, it would have become more complicated from so e Just, uh, scroll to the options. Let's go back meeting a description. The date, the duration. No registration required. Generate the i d automatically. No password required here. It really doesn't matter. Computer audio allowed the joint before the host mute participants on entry enable a waiting room and the rest can be active. So that's it. I have created the If I click safe, I have now created a schedule meeting. So now what I can do is I can take this link and I can share it with my club members think this is your link for the meeting on so enter date and that's a you have your scheduled the meeting. Simple. There's a very simple way. No. Now, before I move ahead, I just want to see I see a lot of people in the Let me stop the sharing. Well, we have what, 72 participants next round the pool and see who's who's here. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to run a full now and share the results with you. So first of all I have is what's your experience using zone rate yourself? Are you an expert? This is your first time. Unusual. Please accept my apologies that I won't be ableto monitor the church because I can't. Oh, I'm not that much of a multitasking guy. So I will look at the church maybe later on and then maybe most responses in the in the WhatsApp group. So we have a good amount off responses on board. I will end the polling in three, 21 So, as you can see, we have some first timers, some who have attended some meetings. Some have conducted with things, and we have to experts. Which is great, right? We can share from each other on understand. Okay. I'll do one more poll because I want to know where you're from. Uh huh. What? Equality is willing. Yeah, I'm happy to say so. Money off members of my where those masters from Byron joining us. It's excellent. I will close the pole in three, 21 God. So as we can say way, have people who have attended this meeting for the first time. So for them, it might be a little overwhelming toe go to the room and create a meeting from scratch. That's why I have created the What's that proof? I want you. If you are really interested in doing your own some meetings, as I said, go to zoom com, create an account. One of the instruction that I have shared and I'll be sharing the power point Also in the woods. That group create the meeting. Maybe in the initial stage, just have a meeting with two or three people. Then you can practice for your actually toastmaster meeting. Make a trail run with your ex, Come maybe see how it works, and then you can do that Phil Toastmaster mating. Now we move into the controls related toe Like, how did I create this pool? How did I share the hold with you all? And how could you do so? You could use a poor like this, for example, in a toastmaster meeting for choosing the best speaker or the best table topic. Best role player. So now you have one rule less required in toastmaster meetings. You don't need a word counter. Correct. Because the toastmaster off the day will create the polls. And once the speaking segment is over, launched the ball and that's it. You know who is the best speaker and and we will do that for the people topics. By the way, today now comes once the meeting started. So basically that I have started created this meeting. Whenever you're ready to start the meeting, I will share my screen once again. So I have created this meeting with all these parameters. And if I want if I know all the speakers in advance, for example, I could create the pool also at the same time. So how do I do that? I can say add a poll. So for this meeting that I have just created. I will say, for example, best speaker. Good. So let's say please choose the best. Speak up, Let's say the impala Rashid. Okay with them. Uh, still month. Okay. Yeah. And for example, so you can keep this polls saved in advance so that when the meeting segment is over, you don't waste the time creating the full during the meeting time. The polls are already ready. You're up and running. When it is timeto deliver, the select the speaker and only requires them is to say start the meeting. Once you start the meeting, it will open the zoom meeting that I am running now. Off course, I can't start this meeting because I'm already running one meeting. If I do that, my whole current meeting will sort off go for a toss. So all you have to do is click start meeting and it will do Well. It will start the new waiting for you. But now, since I'm only running the meeting what I want to show explain to use How do you control this meeting? How am I making sure that the speaker is not getting distracted? How am I making sure that the focus off the meeting remains on one person. So the first thing that we need to understand is how we can mute and a mute people. And so then you are the host, especially. I again recommend that you should do this from a laptop or a computer is your host and you open the zoom meeting. You will have all the controls required to run the meeting and the first thing important that we should do this mute and a mute. So I'm not going toe. I cannot show you my zoom screen because it will become like a zoom inception because screen inside the screen. But what happens is you have a simple option. They're called mute all but that's fine. You think all everyone understand it will Newt everybody except you. But the important control that is there is when you do it all, there is another option. They're called, allow participants toe on mute themselves. And the question is, should I allow participants to unload themselves? Who thinks we should allow participants to on a mute themselves? Anybody? No, right? No, don't let the participants on. Muted because they might do it by mistake. On what if the speaker is speaking? Hey will get distracted. So the important thing when you are muting everybody is to make sure that participants won't be allowed ableto mute themselves. So that's the first control as a toastmaster off the day, or the person who is running this meeting and my recommendation is again the toastmaster off the day is the person who is running the meeting, who's organizing it? Ah, making sure all the members have the right meeting link and the common time and so forth. So he will handle the muting and a muting. The second part is, should you record the meeting and we have two options available for you, you can record on your computer or you can record it on the cloud. That difference is off course. If you start recording on the cloud that is on the zoom service, then they will start counting how much space you're occupying. And then there will be a limit. I'm not very sure what's my limit? Maybe once your GP, but once then you have to start paying. So I prefer toe record on my PC, and then I simply upload it to YouTube because YouTube is free and I can share it with everybody. Okay, so but you can choose. You can say I want to record my meeting on the cloud or on the thing. Or don't be quite it out because it's up to you. It's up to the club members. Maybe they don't want to share. They are meeting with the rest of the people. It's the club decision and the second thing. And if you notice, I keep on shifting my eyes because I am checking. If new members are joining in because the they will not directly come into the meeting room, they'll be in the lobby. So I have to keep admitting them from the lobby as then when they come, because in my meeting control, I have said enable painting room. So once they enable it, whenever a member locks him, he will not come directly into this meeting somebody, the toastmaster off the day or the control has to admit him into the meat. So very simple controls for the toastmaster of the day, muting. And then, whenever you want toe a mute them, let's try this. Why not? Let's let me on mute everybody and see what kind of cacophony that we get E O. And that is probably you'll do it during the break time so people would say hi to each other and off course. There won't be this many people in most meetings, but that's how you will do it. But when it comes to controlling, who will speak? The idea is that you should a new mute, one person at a time who's going to deliver the next speech? Uh huh. Once he finishes Mu team again. But yeah, also, there are different views off the meeting. So there is something called a speak of you and there is something called a gallery view. I don't know whether you all can see it, because when you switched will speak of you. The person speaking takes up your whole screen. When you switch to the gallery view. Then all those speakers will be visible. Now for me, if I am delivering my speech, I will always keep a gallery of you because I want to monitor. I don't want to see my face right. I want to see what effect I am having on the other people. But you share audience member. You might prefer to use the speak of you because you want to see the screen what the person is saying clearly on so that you can give it back to the person. Okay. Is that clear? The gallery view and speak of you Speak of you should be for audience. The gallery view ideally, should be when the speaker is delivering his speech. And so the speakers please. Not today. When city Um Wafa you're giving a speech switch toe gallery view so that you can see all of us control with your speech. The next party comes to the sharing off the screen. And now, ofcourse there it will be a control for you to share. And again, as a meeting controller, you can decide whether anybody in the audience can share or only I can share for this particular meeting. The sharing for you will be disabled because I have made sure that only the host can share not the attendees, but again, it's a control that is available for you and the pools. I have already shown you how to create a poll. It's a very simple thing, and the poll can be modified. Also, suppose, Let's say you have created a pole as we saw for three speakers. Onda. While the meeting started, we realized that we offer has dropped out. She had some very busy meeting somewhere, so I can just go to the polls and then say, Modify the poll on Bond edited. It will take me back to that same screen that I had created where I can remove her name and then launched the pole after the speakers have completed their segment. And the last thing is the chat. Some of you might have seen the chat that you can share messages while the meeting is going on, and this could be used from a toastmaster perspective to give feedback after the speaker has spoken. We used to write this chips. Right now there is no chips. It's which what you're. So you can then write a message as a feedback to the speaker. Because you have two ways off delivering feedback. You can when you're writing the message, you can say this message is for this particular person only. So it's like a private message on Lee. That person will say, or you can say it's for everyone. So the whole group against it So Chad could be used mostly as far as a toastmaster is one meeting is concerned. Toe provide feedback by the audience to the speaker or to the table topics. Anything that happened, you want to give feedback, you produce this option. Okay, so I'll just summarize What are the things that we will you have to do to run the meeting properly? You have to have a good understanding off muting and on. You think it's It will hardly take you any time to get hand off that wants to create a meeting, decide whether you want to record the meeting or not. Then keep an eye on the lobby. If you have enabled the lobby so that members come, you bring them inside the meeting room, the speaker view and the gallery view. I hope you'll have understood when to use. What share the screen. Eso If the speaker, for example, this brings me toe question off sharing screen. What if you want to deliver project like research and presentation where you have to deliver a PowerPoint So the easiest way off course would be toe Lord, the PowerPoint use the share option and show the power point to the audience. But then what about you? Where are you? In this picture? You'll be a small box right somewhere in the screen. So that is something you have to decide as a speaker. Is it worked toe? Use a power point because the focus goes away from you. Your power point becomes the presentation. No, not you. So that is one off the challenges off zoom meeting because you have to choose one or the other. So if you have some research numbers or some things to be shown, perhaps you could only show it, uh, at the time that is required, share the screen and then stop sharing so that the focus again moves back to you for delivering your speech. Polls ran a poll toe. Select the best speaker or whatever on you are ready toe. Hold your first. Those master meeting. Now, before we do our demo meeting, I would now open the floor. We have 10 minutes for any, um e related to what I have spoken. So the way it will work is you can either raise your hands if you on video. I can see you and s o I Mr Danish has, uh I'm having despond monitor. Um, I can't see the initial audio controls. There is some problem, I think for you. Let me search. Okay. A mute. Okay, Dennis, you have a question. Please proceed. Yeah. Good evening, Toe. Olive. You the fellow Toastmasters and the moderator and the area director division director. I love you. Very sort askew, Say, told me about the setting the screen. And I am joined the meeting on the mobile, not the let off. So if I say the screen are anyone at the service screen, whatever I can see the window that will be only shared our will goto full participant. The street. No. Whatever you share will become the main screen on this. Whatever the zoom meeting that it will take up the almost the whole thing. And on top, you'll see the participants in small boxes. Okay, the sharing basically takes over the entire screen. So that's why as far as a toastmaster meeting is concerned, I highly discourage sharing screens because here we are in those master meeting. We're here to develop our skills, talking skills in a communication skills. The focus should be only on communication. Thank you. A ridge effort. You had raised your hands. So I'm handing the mic to you. Yeah. Hi. I was talking to my mom. Okay. Anybody else is the question. I'm trying to see any. Okay. Okay, I see. And where, uh, question my question was I saw this interesting feature of how you created the pool. But how do you post it? So you shared with us how you created How do you share it while in a meeting? Okay. So again, I can't show the screenshot, but when I send you the power point, you you'll find it there. Basically, once you open the screen zoom meeting, there is a small button which is pull when you click on that pole button. Whatever polls we had created in the previous screener, which I showed you, they will pop up and you just choose one off them. So if you have created two or three polls, it will give you option. Which poll do you want to run? And then it will appear on the screen after attendees. Okay. On the same thing with the lobby. I think only you would be able to see the waiting room, right? Only you can. Okay. Off course you can have. You can have something called a co host. So as a backup if something went wrong here, I have made Priscilla as the co host. So if I find some technical problems, she would be able to then monitor and accept the people. Thank you. Thank you for those insightful questions. Anybody else? Okay, Isha, over to, uh, custom you mentioned about you would have to buy the membership part. Just a clarification. So I think the ones as you, for example, if you're conducting a meeting, I think that's quite important that you would have to buy all of the participants. All the participants off the club? No, for participants, it is free. They can log in from the phone. Any device? Nobody. The participants don't have to pay. The only the meeting host has to pay for it. So normally that would be the club, right? The club would, Which is it? Or maybe a couple of clubs will share because they can share because not all clubs meet at the same time. So one day one club can use that. I d the next day Another, maybe the district can share with us. For them, $15 is nothing s Uh huh. On off course. I have offered my my idea for you. Whoever just message me and you're you're afraid to use it. Okay, Thanks a lot. Thank you. I'm checking. Anybody else is a question. I'm really You raised your hands. Okay, go ahead. Similar toe patients, Recent questioning. Uh, please. Your two devices are always causing problems. Okay? Yeah. Uh huh. Yes. Please proceed. Yeah. You're using two devices next to each other and that I'm just coming out. Okay. Connect like this for a moment. I dinner every day. Meeting can be convicted. Yes. Okay. For 24 hours you can conduct. That means one morning. One evening one night and do it for 20 or 30 days. No problem. Walk. Okay. Thank no limits. Anybody else has a question. If not, we will start. Okay. As Fandy. How would you? Can you hear me? Okay. Great. Uh, my question is you said we could share it to the members, but what do we do? How do we share this for non members? Like if we want to publicize the meeting. It's the uh you have to decide if, for example, Guest and this is by the recently a discussion in the official group. Also, is it good thing, toe, Let's say Bring guest toe online meeting like this, and it's a decision you have to take because will he get the same experience? Because he may say, Oh, I can pay a few dollars and enroll in tow one off the public speaking courses that are available. What do I get? And you may lose the potential guest. There is this possibility because he may not get it good experience, especially if the meeting is not conducted at the highest standards. For example, um, you don't have a team would like me to run the meeting Andan. Let's say there is a lot of disturbance on. He might get a bad impression, which you would not get if he comes toe club and experiences it. So really, the choice is yours. But if you decide for a guest to join, fine, just take the same link and tell him join from your phone or whatever. It's the same thing. It doesn't matter. It come as a guest because it's I mean, like, uh, the news just came that they're going to do a complete shutdown. Uh, and so I can imagine that we might be using this forum for a tely least two weeks, probably a month, or maybe even more, depending on how the situation progresses. So, Inshallah, we'll all get pretty good at this. Yep. That's why we're here. So that we get good at it. Okay, thank you very much. Anybody else wants any questions on way are right. We can take the maximum one question, and then we will start with a demo meeting. So now you're going to experience what a meeting will actually feel like. And then what you can do is take this learnings and try to simulate it and make it exactly like that in your meeting. And so that would show you how you will introduce the speakers on. So I will be controlling the meeting. So when I introduce somebody, you will notice that I will be a muting only that person, as I have done now during the organization. So that ensures that the meeting remains clean. Everyone can focus on what is being said on We're ready. So are we all ready to start the meeting? The demo meeting. I would advise as many as possible to enable your video now, because if our speakers are talking toe blank screens, they may not feel so enthusiastic about delivering their speeches. So let me before I start the meeting, let us check the agenda on. I will. And it will make your host to just make sure. Priscilla, I'm okay. Can I just review the agenda? Timer? Can you your ideas your time around? Okay. Generally value de temporally. Everything looks okay. All right. I can see a raised hand grammarian and a counter.

It came off a settlement. First Impressions. Bill and Hillary Clinton also tell the story how they met. They locked eyes at Yale Slow Library until Hillary broke the silence on Marsh towards Bill. She said, Hey, if you keep looking at me and I will keep stirring back, we might as well be introduced. I'm Hillary wrote him. What's your name? Bill has said he could not remember his own name. That waas a first impression. And it Wasim a more a ble one sauce master off the evening Hello Toastmasters and 61 evaluator. Good evening. First impression is very critical in our life, as in short period of time, others will form opinions about us based on our appearance, our body language, our gestures and our character. So we need to make sure that this first impression is a good one and memorable one. I will talk today about how to make that good first impression. However, mind you that sometimes it's inevitable. But we need try to do the best that we can to make our first impression un forgettable. I will give you three kids the first step keep a charming smile. They say that it's mine. When you smile, the word smiles to you, and there's nothing like a smile that guarantees a positive reaction. Whenever you do whatever you go, just smile and you will see people smiling at you. So it's the first key off a good first impression. Mom used to tell me that I need to smile more, so I start practicing smiling. Lately I am. I put smiling face on my computer in my room. So whenever I see, I smile, especially at my office. Whenever I'm talking over the phone, I smile. I put a word smile. You are over the porn. The second tip, uh, dress appropriately dress to impress. I know nowadays, our word is more casual than it used to be 20 years ago, however, it's important to dress the part. It took me years to be convinced. I used to argue with Bob a lot, and I always tell her who cares? How do I look and dress the most important? It should be clean and tidy, she used to tell me. Yes, they say a picture is worth 1000 bucks, and the way you present yourself to the people. That's how your image. It's been memorable, therefore, took me years, but I eventually persuaded, and I dressed according to the situation. Now, the third tip I want to give you there's speak clearly. Oliver had Oliver Windham said. Speak clearly. If you won't speak at all, carved every word before you let it fall. It's very important when we are speaking to speak clearly and slowly, especially for us. We are non native speakers, and when we are communicating, not in our language. If we start to speak quickly, nobody can understand and they would not understand our roads. So I practiced how to listen to the last letter off every word I say to make my world as clear as possible. So even if I'm talking not their mother tongue language like now I feel and I'm seeing that all people are understanding what I'm saying. He spent to conclude Our perception is based on the thing that we see from the first impression of people. Now is the first impression I lost impression. Well, it's debatable. Some people say Yes, it is, and others say no, it's not. Whatever is the case, sometimes the first impression cannot be Revise herbal. Sometimes you meet people once and you don't have the opportunity to meet them again. So whatever image you showed them, it will stuck in their memory. My advisors is that three simple that make your first impression A memorable one. First one share a chair, a charming smile. Second dress appropriately to impress people. And third is speak clearly. If you follow these steps your first impression, it will not just be good. It will be a memorable one back to you. Got master of the evening e because of my feet. Although e Okay, here's I'm sorry. I was muted So you have one minute to write some feedback toe dtm Bopha on duh. You can write it in the chat either directly to detain Wafa or to everyone. Yes, and now we will next move on.

Inevitably, this walls around us because we are the center of our universe. Andi, be as human beings are capable of adjusting toe any surrounding any situation. There are people living in the Antarctic, the Arctic, six there, people living in deserts. It is always be inhabited by human being. So humankind is able to adjust itself toe any surrounding. That is one of the best thing about being a human, uh, creatures, though maybe adaptable to some particular surrounding because that's where they live in the card server. Elsewhere, human beings like I left my village in the I left my country. India and I have been living in Gulf for 35 years. Even though I don't know Arabic, I have still managed to survive here. So being adjustable adaptable is one of the conditions that human beings are capable off and always will be. OD. Thank you so much trash By that we'll have our second volunteer for tonight.

So adaptability is the simple secret off survival Adaptability is the simple secret Off survival. Do you agree or disagree? Floor is yours. Thank you very much. Table topic Master Fellow Toastmasters, Distinguished dignitaries. I totally agree with this topic. Adopted adaptability is the simplest secret secret off survival. Have you ever noticed people among the world? If you see at the largest tricks I mean sorry. Status tricks. Many off. Those who married are not happy because they don't have Children. There are people, our widows. It could be a man. It could be a woman. Your great Toastmasters? Yes. At home? Yes. No. The secret off happiness is something that you adopt often child Infant, baby. Our poor child who lost their father or mother. The secret off survival for them is immense. It doesn't come to the context of the world survival. It itself defines them that they want to live mawr than 100 years. Because the paramount off happiness, the joy, the instill nous, the instinct to the ability of confidence, courage and persistence the poor with the Lao affection. They don't know their mother and father just because you adopted a child who was orphan. And given your love the bond has created to conclude, I must say that there are those who blessed with little ones there are those who blessed with nothing. But the opportunity is yours. You can make a choice off adopting a child. There are many off those who are lingering living in camps. Syrian Childs. They don't have parents. They don't have food to survive. Adopt and live your life to the fullest. Back to you. Thank you. Thank you so much from with the big close Thio. Um, let's rock it out here. Okay, then let's out. Have our third participant for tonight and here. And we have somebody from barren, please. Yeah, we're not for sure. I cannot see hands Reason, But it's your control. Who would like to take up the challenge. Please raise your hands. Who dare to come to me? So we're not Push well will not force We push something like that you can choose. You can choose. E cannot catch anybody from you. So let's have Sandy. I can see her in front. Off me. Here. Straight hair. Okay, I got to Sandy, Uh, you have other numbers? Like 124 and six six. Perfect. So you're saying to be train your mind to see the good in every situation? Train your mind to see the good in every situation Talk about Sandy Stain floor is yours Time sign Stein, Everybody. Good evening, Toastmasters and our wonderful online forum. The the idea of keeping a positive mind is something we really have toe have, especially at this time as thes notices air going around, coronavirus, Don't go anywhere. Look out! We're going to catch you and you're going to get it and you're going to die. And people are panicked everywhere and for myself. The way that I do that is to really kind of turn off. Ah, lot of those social media things. And instead I focus on things like prayer. Uh, reading funny books or watching humorous shows. I love cartoons and just really spending quality time with the people around me and trying very hard to avoid all of that negativity. So if you focus your thoughts and your time on the positive things yes, those those negative events are happening around us. We can't. We can't change what other people are thinking. What's happening around us. All we can do is change how we are adapting to it. How What is our response to all of this? And so if we work on focusing our response on positive ideas, what can we do? What can we change? And how are we able to do things that could help ourselves or help others? Then it helps you to get rid of that panic, to calm things down and not to kind of freak out as so many people are and back to you. Toast table topic Master. Thank you so much, Sandy. Amazing. Everybody stay positive. No panic here all around. So let's have our fourth participant. And the drum roll goes to either you raise your hand on your be picked up on the photo. Uh huh. Catchy control. I don't know the head if the hands are raised or not. No, I can't see anybody So somebody will be selected. And here we dio be ready. We'll have Faisal Jamil very soon. Okay. It's the online myself. Oh, moving forward. If he's not, will come toe five for three Do one time is money will move forward to another one name Toastmaster will. Well ready. So this is why they say table topics is the most fun and having fun in the whole meeting as everyone um everything goes serious and formal. So let's have fun. Enjoy the segment. So bear with me here. So, Mr Will you have to select either one to and for number four, number four. Okay. It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive. But those who can best manage change It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive. But those who can best manage change those master Will it even cause masters? A lot of times we believe that the strongest person or the smartest person is the best person in the situation ever in life We all have changes always occur So the person that actually can adapt to any changes. Actually, the strongest person or the most, um, in official person, like in this situation here, dealing with the situation, going around the country with the virus, you know it might be the strongest person might be the most healthy person. Every might getting sick ever if you adapt, have a positive mental attitude and realize that this effect is only temporary, you can actually go through this a lot easier. Similar to is being tonight have a lot of great speakers, a lot of great I waiters ever adapting to the change even though if they have meetings individually, come together and being in this form to have a meeting a lying is actually encouraging. Change current stability and make ensuring that we continue to survive even though circumstances are not best. So basically, inclusion like to emphasize that don't have to be the smartest. Don't have to be the strongest have having a strong will to when you face your problem to adapt to it. To make a change to overcome solution is always the best if not next. Thank you so much. Will Amazing. Yeah, now I just would like toa since we're running slightly. Five minutes behind schedule, I think can be finished with topics. Yes, for sure. Okay, there is 11 speaker who has raised the hand and we can't ignore Rohana. I'm handing over to hello only now. Hi. Can you hear me? The actual Okay, Sarah, You know you would like to participate here and you will be our last participant for the segment. So you can choose either one or two. What? So what adaptability is about the powerful difference between adapting toe coal? Onda adapting to win adaptability is about the powerful difference between adapting toe cope Onda adapting to win Rogina floor is yours. Thank you. There is no good evening to all off you hear on. Duh! I'm not sure how Muirfield are watching me, but good evening and hi to all adaptability. I think what we're doing right now is a very big form off adaptability. If Darwin was alive, he would have said, Wow, you know what a different change or a different change. We brought ourselves to cope to cope with the circumstances that happening nowadays and what we're doing toe overcome those circumstances how we can overcome those problems and make them through to our solutions and give ourselves solutions like catch eaten has done today. I mean, not only today, but I know this room. It has bean invoked for some time now, but actually working with it, working on it, working with it, I'm working with all off you. It gives us more adaptability. What makes us more are confident. And when you are confident, definitely you're going to win. So I think everyone has to undergo a change if you don't change. Because change is the only thing that is constant in this world. And if you don't change because change is inevitable, you cannot do without change. In today's world today I heard that everything is going to close down the demands to be met and supplies are going to be less so. I think everyone's going to be again, you know, being the panic state, running around, finding solutions for that. But you know what? What we need to do has become patient watch, adapt ourselves so that we can win in this situation. Thank you. Over to you. Thank you so much. Rogina, back toe our controller for this, uh, meeting the amazing and the best catch eaten back to you. Thank you. Okay, That was an amazing table topic segment.

Those pastors on a special Good evening Toe Master today Reviews. Now we're starting the General evaluation evaluation session. Onda Azul. You know we had only one speaker first speaker on the one The speaker is our district director Tedium off Haselman on my request. Our evaluator, our CGT dtm alka camera to do the evaluation before that may request our timer to give away the timing for the evaluation. The timing for the evaluation session will be 2 to 3 minutes. But two minutes I will show the green card at 2.5 minutes. The yellow card And at three minutes the red card. You have 30 seconds, Grace, period things typing is for the evaluators as well as the grammarian over to General Evaluator. Thank you. Dtm Alka Camera First evaluator Dtm Alka Camera. The voice is a reflection off. What is going on inside us? Good evening to all the attendees General evaluated toastmaster off the day on to my target Speaker detained Wafa Selma Well, she she showed to us today through her project. How important in the way we speak now I would like to ask you why do we need variety in our vocals? Why do we need variety in our workers? Well, for the simple reason variety is the spice off life the same way when we have a writing our workers, it impacts the way we communicate with others and the reaction off others. Now what I loved about today's speech off buff awas the introduction that she gave first of all about ah very important are well known Pair Bill and Hillary Clinton. How important the first impression is. Well, there. She also displayed some vocal variety and also what I loved about her speech Waas variety at many places, most notably at the point where she spoke about her mom on, she said Mom told her, how important, Dressing up well, Waas. So that was the most notable local variety that I saw in her speech today. Also, what I liked about her speech is the pauses, the well articulated speech, the articulation that was shown through the pauses when, especially when she spoke about speaking clearly the importance of speaking clearly in first impression. So she spoke. We need to listen to the last letter off every word. So each off these word waas well emphasized to show the importance coming to a few areas where I would suggest that she can add to the already experienced way off speaking. She has the first is even though there was a lot of vocal variety. I found she could have added a little more variety in the introduction. Plus, she could have added a few more few dialogues, especially when talking to Mom. And she could have showed a little more emotion there by saying something like, When the mom say is jesting, a bell is important. No, no, Mom, it's okay. I don't care much. So that's the way to show a little more vocal variety on a few emotions as well. Now coming toe. One more important aspect off vocal variety, which is the rate the rate off speech that I found WAAS not much varied. It waas more or less flat. So if the rate off speech is a little up and down, it is more made, more waited and exciting. It would add more flavor to that speech overall a wonderful speech about creating a first impression, how to keep maintaining it and how to add vocal variety toe the speech. But a few more few points that I suggested on the speech would be a great one over to you. Generally value it. Thank you very much. A CD and evaluator. Thank you very much.

We seem to have some technical difficulties on. Maybe he was trying to correct me in the system. Decided that I cannot be corrected Coming. Okay, Back to you, General value later. Thank you very much. Moderator and Tia Marie as a general value to my evolution for today's meeting. First of all, the meeting was very good. Let's all give a big applause. Tow our district as well as the moderator for doing a great job. Excellent. The training was there from 6 to 7 on. He made it sure, although it was over at 5. 14. Very true. With the all the doubts can be cleared at seven. The meeting started sharply the demo meeting. So that's Ah, great point to be Notre Onda. We are a great subject terms. Who started the meeting very well. The only thing we did not have is a banner that's okay. But coming to the meeting the speaker the first two speakers are first to speech Was a first impression. Very good. She started with a beautiful message, not a message thing which we have to appreciate presence of mind, she said Always 61 evaluators. Wow! She noted that before intimating I mean before going to her speech. Andi, I would also like to add that our speech was very good. She gave all the three points and recapitulated that at the end, which is the great thing coming to table topic session. You know the excellent, lovely topics given by our topics. Master Close Master Najma Onda We appreciate moderator again as he knew that the time of timing was time was going on in military. It was curtailed by five o'clock without having the last speaker so greater time management on our time. You did a great job. Very stressed faster. Priscilla. A great job, Priscilla. Only one thing I would like to suggest is the yellow card. It's not seen clearly in that light. Maybe you should have a different just for improvement for next time. Otherwise, the meeting was very good. Coming to the evaluation. Our evaluator rule medium Alka Camera, our city did a great evaluation. Onda Grammarian For the first time, he's made it within the time frame as well as he a counter role. However, I would like to mention that both Raj and Raj used to the world today. Twice on Reina used the word today once which is, I mean, maybe must have not seen. Overall, the meeting was excellent. Is a great experience inevitable that we have to go into this type of meeting our we enjoyed. It's really good to see. Even now we have so many partisan now the closer we have 42 participants. That shows the meeting has been very successful on growth to the district, especially double support to our more greater as far as to the co host. We're forgetting the co host was done. A great job. My evaluation is over. I'll leave it to the hand it over to our moderator and toastmaster today. Area Director Caxton Burrito. Thank you very much. Thank you. And so that for y'all was a sample off. What online meeting would look like? So now you have the tools. You know what? It has to be done. All of you are not supposed to be the next level. Now, who will take up this role to your own clubs and say, Okay, I'm going to make a meeting, make a zoom account or borrow my account. Asked district to make one zoom account for you. Banana meeting executed. Maybe you might still struggle for some things. How do I do that? Knewton did it like this. The WhatsApp group will be kept open for some time for you to discuss your issues. Because as you know, I'm not the only person. There are some experts also in the same group. They will also share some ideas with you. Feel free to use this group toe. Learn more. Get more tips. Plan your meetings. Execute them. Most importantly, share your experiences with us. What is it that you have done? What do you think you did? Well, what do you think you can improve upon? And Phil? The government tells us otherwise. I wish you all the best in online meeting management. And now I will hand over the podium toe a district director to keep her impression. Do some wrap up on this meeting on close exactly as scheduled at eight o'clock? No. Okay. Thank you very much. Uh, the master of the evening. And I'm so happy that till the end of 42 members out there, it was an amazing meeting. It was a good experience for me. I attended several meetings in Europe and us online, but the attendees were, like maximum 2016, something like that. So it's a different experience. I'm so happy that we are all enthusiastic on keeping our thought masters meeting running regardless off any case, the most important safety comes first. That's the most important for us. I want you to be safe. Don't go out unless it's urgent to go out. Stay home, Stay safe. And if there is anything we need. We are connected to each other through groups. This is what's called that on Masters family and we are a family. I want all of you to depend on each other. Asked for help if we need the meeting was amazing. It waas organized from the beginning. Sylvie End was followed by the agenda. And if you notice that the table topics took a little bit time that those master off the evening control that and put everything on track because of this, we're trying to end off time. I saw that this meeting is a professional meeting and I'm sure that if you run it in your club, it will help members to stay connected. And I hope it will be short. And we will be back to our normal Toastmasters meeting that we all love to enjoy and be there. So that's it In brief. I enjoyed it and thank you, Cash Houston and the co host for the technically running that show and taking our wish and make it a reality. I'm so happy. And Chapel Bob Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. District Director. And there is one final thing to be done. And that is to announce the best table topics speaker and notice that I did not share the whole off the best table topics speaker. Because if you do that, then it doesn't have the same feeling off toastmaster meeting. So a toastmaster off the day because I read them all. It is my privilege than to announce that the best table topics speaker in this case, of course, best Speaker is only one. So by default, best speaker is uh, uh dtm buffer. But the best table, Tom. Yes, with a very high percentage off falling on very good competition from all of them. Please give a big round of applause toe Johanna for the best table toffee andi that I conclude the meeting. I will keep it open for another one or two minutes. Anybody has any E? Okay. Anybody? Uh, yes, merrily Yeah. I just would like toa I mean, there's not one of the meeting, but I would like toa request people. Please put your name in the attack. Not iPhone del all those things because we would like to know your name, so please avoid putting iPhone. Um then whatever it is just a request s so that we can No, you with the person. Thank you. And with that. Thank you very much. Good night on Happy on land Meeting E Children. The meeting? Yeah. \"\"\""

        "gold_summary = \"\"\" It was a Zoom Online and Training Meeting held by some fellow toastmasters and some dignitaries.Due to the sudden lockdown and pandemic situation they were facing problems and they decided to start their meetings through a virtual platform. They choose Zoom online meeting app for their meetings ,and they set some ground rules for their meeting to be productive. The most important thing is to get least possible distraction and for that the rules were to put their mobile phones on silent choose a valid and fresh environment to attend their toastmaster meeting.Their videos should be on and all the members leaving the speaker would be muted. They would have a new meeting id for every meeting. The members can raise their hands or text something during the meeting if they want to give their feedback or ask something about the current speech going on.After all the general instructions ,their demo meeting starts .They had three role players namely the timer ,the grammarian and the general evaluator. The timer would note the time of every speech and indicate the speaker about qualifying their given times.the grammarian would play a close attention to the languages used and finally the general evaluator would see how the meeting goes from beginning to the end. Their project was to practice using vocal variety.The first speaker had the topic \"FIRST IMPRESSION\".as said by the speaker First Impressionis very critical in our life, as i short period of time , others will form opinion about us based on opur apperances, our body language ,our gestures and our character. So having a perfect first impression is very important . There are three steps to keep in mind to havea good first impression. The first one is to always keep a charming smile. A smile indicates positivity and optimism which is a good thing.The next is to dress well.One should always be in a clean and tidy dress and avoid casuals. The third and the last one is to speank clearly and slowly so that the listener would always be clear about our thoughts.Their next project was table topics and all of the topics were centrered on adaptation and survival. The speakers had different opinions. One speaker says that human beings ,compared to other creatures are highly adaptable to almost any situation for survival. The next speaker syas that adaptability is the simplest secret of survival.Another speaker suggested to be centered to the positivity and avoid all the negative aspects of any situation. There was another one who said that one mustn't be the smartest or the strongest but should be willing to change to overcome problems.When we change according to the circumstances that builds a confidence insid us and when we have confidencewe'll surely overcome any situation . \"\"\""

        "references = [[ \"\"\" It was a Zoom Online and Training Meeting held by some fellow toastmasters and some dignitaries.Due to the sudden lockdown and pandemic situation they were facing problems and they decided to start their meetings through a virtual platform. They choose Zoom online meeting app for their meetings ,and they set some ground rules for their meeting to be productive. The most important thing is to get least possible distraction and for that the rules were to put their mobile phones on silent choose a valid and fresh environment to attend their toastmaster meeting.Their videos should be on and all the members leaving the speaker would be muted. They would have a new meeting id for every meeting. The members can raise their hands or text something during the meeting if they want to give their feedback or ask something about the current speech going on.After all the general instructions ,their demo meeting starts .They had three role players namely the timer ,the grammarian and the general evaluator. The timer would note the time of every speech and indicate the speaker about qualifying their given times.the grammarian would play a close attention to the languages used and finally the general evaluator would see how the meeting goes from beginning to the end. Their project was to practice using vocal variety.The first speaker had the topic \"FIRST IMPRESSION\".as said by the speaker First Impressionis very critical in our life, as i short period of time , others will form opinion about us based on opur apperances, our body language ,our gestures and our character. So having a perfect first impression is very important . There are three steps to keep in mind to havea good first impression. The first one is to always keep a charming smile. A smile indicates positivity and optimism which is a good thing.The next is to dress well.One should always be in a clean and tidy dress and avoid casuals. The third and the last one is to speank clearly and slowly so that the listener would always be clear about our thoughts.Their next project was table topics and all of the topics were centrered on adaptation and survival. The speakers had different opinions. One speaker says that human beings ,compared to other creatures are highly adaptable to almost any situation for survival. The next speaker syas that adaptability is the simplest secret of survival.Another speaker suggested to be centered to the positivity and avoid all the negative aspects of any situation. There was another one who said that one mustn't be the smartest or the strongest but should be willing to change to overcome problems.When we change according to the circumstances that builds a confidence insid us and when we have confidencewe'll surely overcome any situation . \"\"\"\r\n",

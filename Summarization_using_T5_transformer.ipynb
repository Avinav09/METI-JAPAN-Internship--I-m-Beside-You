If there are no objections, the minutes will be corrected to include the name of Commissioner McCroskey. Will the clerk please make this correction. Any further corrections? Seeing none, without objection the minutes will stand approved as read. (This is sort of a short cut way that is commonly used for approval of minutes and/or the agenda rather than requiring a motion and second.)Chairman Wormsley: Commissioner Adkins, the first item on the agenda is yours.Commissioner Adkins: Mister Chairman, I would like to make a motion to approve the resolution taking money from the Data Processing Reserve Account in the County Clerk's office and moving it to the equipment line to purchase a laptop computer.Commissioner Carmical: I second the motion.Chairman Wormsley: This resolution has a motion and second.

Seeing no objection, this motion is withdrawn. The next item on the agenda is Commissioner Rodgers'.Commissioner Rodgers: I move adopton of the resolution previously provided to each of you to increase the state match local litigation tax in circuit, chancery, and criminal courts to the maximum amounts permissible. This resolution calls for the increases to go to the general fund.Chairman Wormsley: Commissioner DuckettCommissioner Duckett: The sheriff is opposed to this increase.Chairman Wormsley: Commissioner, you are out of order because this motion has not been seconded as needed before the floor is open for discussion or debate. Discussion will begin after we have a second. Is there a second?Commissioner Reinhart: For purposes of discussion, I second the motion.Chairman Wormsley: Commissioner Rodgers is recognized.Commissioner Rodgers: (Speaks about the data on collections, handing out all sorts of numerical figures regarding the litigation tax, and the county's need for additional revenue.)Chairman Wormsley: Commissioner DuckettCommissioner Duckett: I move an amendment to the motion to require 25 percent of the proceeds from the increase in the tax on criminal cases go to fund the sheriff's department.Chairman Wormsley: Commissioner MaloneCommissioner Malone: I second the amendment.Chairman Wormsley: A motion has been made and seconded to amend the motion to increase the state match local litigation taxes to the maximum amounts to require 25 percent of the proceeds from the increase in the tax on criminal cases in courts of record going to fund the sheriff's department. Any discussion? Will all those in favor please raise your hand? All those opposed please raise your hand. The amendment carries 17-2. We are now on the motion as amended. Any further discussion?Commissioner Headrick: Does this require a two-thirds vote?Chairman Wormsley: Will the county attorney answer that question?County Attorney Fults: Since these are only courts of record, a majority vote will pass it. The two-thirds requirement is for the general sessions taxes.Chairman Wormsley: Other questions or discussion? Commissioner Adams.Commissioner Adams: Move for a roll call vote.Commissioner Crenshaw: SecondChairman Wormsley: The motion has been made and seconded that the state match local litigation taxes be increased to the maximum amounts allowed by law with 25 percent of the proceeds from the increase in the tax on criminal cases in courts of record going to fund the sheriff's department.

This is the first time this resolution is under consideration.) Commissioner Hayes is recognized.Commissioner Hayes: I move previous question.Commisioner Crenshaw: Second.Chairman Wormsley: Previous question has been moved and seconded. As you know, a motion for previous question, if passed by a two-thirds vote, will cut off further debate and require us to vote yes or no on the resolution before us. You should vote for this motion if you wish to cut off further debate of the wheel tax increase at this point. Will all those in favor of previous question please raise your hand? Will all those against please raise your hand? The vote is 17-2. Previous question passes. We are now on the motion to increase the wheel tax by $10 to make up the state cut in education funding.
